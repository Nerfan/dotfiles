#Chromebleed
Displays a warning if the site you are browsing is affected by the Heartbleed bug.  

##What does this do?
Many HTTPS-secured sites on the internet use OpenSSL. Unfortunately, a major vulnerability in OpenSSL was disclosed - known as the Heartbleed bug - yesterday that put hundreds of thousands of servers at risk of compromise.  

Whilst some servers have been patched already, many remain that have not been patched. Chromebleed uses a web service developed by Filippo Valsorda and checks the URL of the page you have just loaded. If it is affected by Heartbleed, then a Chrome notification will be displayed. It's as simple as that!  

**Beware of gremlins** - this was developed in about half an hour rather late at night. Bugs will exist somewhere!
